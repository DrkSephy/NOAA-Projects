This repository contains source code of various projects I work on as a Graduate researcher at the City College of New York inside of 
[G.L.A.S.S LAB](https://bitbucket.org/glasslab/profile/members). My tasks involve creating web applications for [NOAA-CREST](http://crest.ccny.cuny.edu/) and subsequently [NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov/).

NOAA SQUAM Granule Visualization
--------------------------------

One of NOAA's web products is the [SST Quality Monitor](http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/sst/squam/HR/index.html#), which maps sea-surface temperature across the globe through granules (images) provided by two satellites which sweep the globe. From the scale below each satellite image, we can see the agreement/disagreement of data, marked by shades of blue and purple. My task was to write scripts and provide JavaScript which would allow users to hover over regions of the globe and display the corresponding granule.
